## 0. Start posture (read first)

Per `GO-NOGO-PREFLIGHT.md` §8(b), V0 starts with the soft requirements below
accepted as **RISK ACCEPTED** with monitors, rather than closed first:

| Item | Posture | Monitor |
|---|---|---|
| SR-1 ADR baseline missing (D-035) | RISK ACCEPTED | This plan + TODO board stand in until `AGENT-VIVY-ARCHITECTURE-V0.md` is authored |
| SR-2 Eino §6 claims unverified (D-034) | RISK ACCEPTED | Closed early by task **A1** (first batch) |
| P0-3 PRD v0.5 final confirmation | RISK ACCEPTED | User sign-off tracked here; treat v0.5 as final until told otherwise |
| P0-4 SR acceptance posture | RESOLVED | This table is the acceptance record |

Gate rule: **A1 must pass before any C6 approval/interrupt work.** If A1 shows
Eino interrupt/resume cannot meet the Vivy Run state machine, C6 switches to
the outer-loop fallback (RK-3 stop-loss) and this board is re-planned.

## 1. Milestone map

| Milestone | PRD §11 | Tasks | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 Spike | M0 | A1, B0, B1, C1, C3 (spike), C4 (spike) | Eino stream + tool wrap cleanly; one HTTP endpoint streams |
| M1 Vertical slice | M1 | A2, A3, B2, B3, B4, B5, C2, C5, D1, D3(min) | AS-1 + AS-8 (mock path) pass |
| M2 Tools & approval | M2 | C6, D2, D3(approval UI) | AS-3, AS-4 pass |
| M3 Recovery & cancel | M3 | E1, E2, E3 | AS-5, AS-6, AS-9 pass |
| M4 Polish & smoke | M4 | D4, E4, real-provider smoke | All AS-1..AS-9 pass on real provider |

## 2. Lane A — Documents & contracts

| ID | Task | Depends | Closes / Anchor |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Author `eino-capability-verify.md`: verify against online Eino v0.9.13 that (a) `CheckPointStore{Get,Set}` exists, (b) default payload serializer, (c) interrupt/resume at Runner level with a public hook for Vivy journal commit | B1 | D-034, SR-2; gates C6 |
| A2 | Provider bundle spec + two YAML bundles (`openai.yaml`, `anthropic.yaml`) with `provenance` field, D-024 field list | B1 | P1-2, OQ-8, D-018/D-022..D-025 |
| A3 | Vivy-owned JSON Schema for the ten `RunEvent` types; single contract for Eino-side and UI-side streams | B3 | P1-3, FR-5 |

## 3. Lane B — Foundation

| ID | Task | Depends | Closes / Anchor |
|---|---|---|---|
| B0 | Persist `GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,direct`; pre-warm module cache | — | SR-7, P1-1 (DONE at init) |
| B1 | `go mod init agent-vivy` + online deps (eino v0.9.13, eino-ext openai v0.1.13, modernc.org/sqlite v1.56.0); build passes | B0 | DONE at init; D-006 |
| B2 | `internal/config` load/validate + `internal/app` composition + `cmd/vivy` health endpoint + graceful shutdown | B1 | FR-10, NFR bounded shutdown |
| B3 | `internal/domain` nine contract types + Run state machine + event vocabulary | B1 | FR-4, FR-5, D-007 |
| B4 | `internal/storage` four contracts + SQLite backend + versioned migrations | B3 | D-026..D-027, FR-8 |
| B5 | Backend conformance suite (≥16 cases, D-032); red at M0, green by M2/M3 | B4 | D-032, RK-7 |

## 4. Lane C — Runtime (the Eino door)

| ID | Task | Depends | Closes / Anchor |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Mock provider (deterministic, reproducible runs) behind `domain.ChatModel` | B3 | FR-3, NFR deterministic mode |
| C2 | `ProviderRef` boundary + openai bundle wiring via eino-ext openai component; enforce non-`provider` packages can't import provider-specific code | A2, B3 | P1-4, FR-3, D-007 |
| C3 | Wire `ChatModelAgent` + `adk.NewRunner` behind `internal/runtime` | B1, C1 | M0 spike, FR-4 |
| C4 | Map Eino `AgentEvent` → `domain.RunEvent`, persist to Journal before fan-out | A3, B3, C3 | FR-5, D-007 |
| C5 | Read-only auto-execute tool (`tool.started`/`tool.finished` without approval) | B3 | FR-6, AS-2 |
| C6 | Effectful approval-gated tool via interrupt/resume + two-layer checkpoint bridge | **A1**, B4, C3 | D-028..D-030, FR-6, AS-3/AS-4 |

## 5. Lane D — API & UI

| ID | Task | Depends | Closes / Anchor |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | HTTP command/query endpoints + SSE `after_seq` replay-then-live stream | B2, B4, C4 | FR-1, FR-5, AS-7 |
| D2 | Approval endpoints with server-side enforcement (binding + expiration) | C6, D1 | FR-7, D-009, RK-6 |
| D3 | Vite UI shell: sessions, streaming chat, approval prompt, run-detail/event-log, error display, refresh-safe | D1 | FR-9, D-013, AS-7 |
| D4 | Playwright smoke against the real Go process; add Eino/`agent-diva` import-lint gate to CI | D3 | FR-9, D-007, RK-1, RK-5 |

## 6. Lane E — Correctness

| ID | Task | Depends | Closes / Anchor |
|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | Cancellation → exactly one `run.cancelled` terminal event (mid-stream, mid-tool, pre-start) | C4 | D-008, AS-5 |
| E2 | Restart recovery: enumerate non-terminal runs, resume or fail definitively, no duplicate terminal | B4, B5, C3 | FR-8, AS-6, RK-7 |
| E3 | Secret-redaction audit: no secret in SQLite, event payloads, or UI storage | B4, C2 | D-010, AS-9 |
| E4 | Windows bounded graceful shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM/console close), flush events, close SQLite | B2, D1 | NFR bounded shutdown, AS gate |

## 7. Dependency graph (tight predecessors)

```text
B0 -> B1
B1 -> {A1, A2, B2, B3, C3}          # fan-out after module init
B3 -> {A3, C1, C5}
A3 -> C4
B3 -> B4 -> B5
A2 -> C2
B3 -> C2
C1 -> C3 -> C4 -> D1
B4 -> D1
B2 -> D1
A1 -+
B4 -+-> C6 -> D2
C3 -+
D1 -> D3 -> D4
C4 -> E1
B4,B5,C3 -> E2
B4,C2 -> E3
B2,D1 -> E4
```

### 7.1 Critical path

```text
B0 -> B1 -> B3 -> C1 -> C3 -> C4 -> D1 -> D3 -> E2 -> M4 acceptance
```

This is the longest dependency chain; compressing it compresses V0. `B3`
(domain types) and `C1` (mock provider) are the highest-leverage early tasks.

### 7.2 Parallel lanes (independent once their predecessor set is met)

- After `B1`: `{A1, A2, B2}` run concurrently — none block each other.
- After `B3`: `{A3, C1, C5, B4}` fan out together.
- `B4/B5` (storage) run fully in parallel with Lane C (runtime).
- `C2` and `C5` run in parallel once their deps are met.
- `D3` UI skeleton can start against the `schemas/` contract as soon as `A3`
  lands, even before `D1` is complete (contract-first), then integrate.

### 7.3 Single points of serialization

- `B3` (domain types): everything downstream speaks domain; do it early, keep
  it stable.
- `A1` (Eino verification): hard gate for `C6`; schedule in the first batch.
- `B5` (conformance suite): must turn green before `E2` is trusted.

## 8. Definition of done per milestone

- **M0:** spike proves Eino stream + tool call wrap cleanly; `eino-capability-verify.md`
  written; GO/NO-GO on the checkpoint-bridge approach.
- **M1:** AS-1 + AS-8 pass on the mock path; vertical slice (session → message →
  stream → persisted run → visible events) real end to end.
- **M2:** AS-3, AS-4 pass; approval server-side enforced; conformance suite green
  for approval cases.
- **M3:** AS-5, AS-6, AS-9 pass; exactly-one-terminal invariant holds under kill.
- **M4:** AS-1..AS-9 all pass against the real provider on Windows; UI smoke
  green; structured errors visible.

## 9. Risk-accepted backlog (not in the critical path)

| Ref | Item | When |
|---|---|---|
| SR-1 / D-035 | Author `AGENT-VIVY-ARCHITECTURE-V0.md` (ADR-001..008) to supersede this plan's stand-in | Before V1 |
| SR-4 / RI-OQ-5 | Decide QwenPaw vendor vs external | Before any fsjournal probe (V1+) |
| SR-5 / RI-OQ-1 | Confirm claude-code upstream license | Before any reuse |
| SR-6 / RI-OQ-2 | Human review of `rig` license | Before any reuse |
| RI-OQ-4 | `.workspace/` versioning policy (commit vs .gitignore) | Before M1 |
| P1-6 | Compose the 16-case conformance harness scaffolding | Folds into B5 |
| P2-5 | Diva capability inventory | Before V1 |

## 10. Completion log

| Date | Item | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-07 | B0, B1 (partial) | Repo initialized: `git init`, `go mod init agent-vivy`, GOPROXY persisted, online deps resolved, skeleton builds (`go build ./...` + `go vet ./...` clean) |
